		<h3>01. Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque</h3> <br/>
		<img src="StyleSheets and Images/Images/1.jpg"> <br/><br/>
		<p>
			Robert Byron once said that the city of Isfahan in Iran was a beautiful enough to rival Athens
			and Rome, yet due to its geographical distance from the Western world, it is seldom explored. 
			It is the location of the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque built between 1602 and 1619 during the reign
			of Shah Abbas I, an architectural masterpiece and a multi-functional space that is also home to 
			royal caravanserai, baths, a royal mint and a hospital.

		<h3>02. Aqsunqur Mosque</h3> <br/>

		<p>
			Dating back to the 14th century, the Aqsunqur Mosque stands proudly in the Egyptian capital,
			Cairo. Reflecting a clear Ottoman style, complete with typical Iznik tiles in the shapes of 
			cypress trees and tulips in vases, the mosque also contains the mausoleums of its founder, 
			Shams El-Din Aqsunqur, and his numerous sons.
		</p>

		<h3>03. Al Haram Mosque</h3> <br/>

		<p>
			Located in the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the Sacred Mosque is perhaps one of the most
			prominent mosques in Islam as it is named by the Qur'an as the first house built for humanity's
			worship of Allah. Not only is Al Haram the largest mosque in the world, but it is considered
			to be the holiest. Covering a colossal 400,800 square meters, it can accommodate up to four
			million people during Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage and a mandatory religious duty for
			Muslims.
		</p>

		<h3>04. Al Aqsa Mosque</h3> <br/>

		<p>
			Situated in the UNESCO-listed Old City of Jerusalem, the Al Aqsa Mosque is a stunning structure
			that has been rebuit several times throughout history due to repeatedly being hit by earthquakes.
			To this day, it remains the third holiest site in Islam for the belief that Muhammad was transported
			here from the Al Haram Mosque in Mecca during the Night Journey, and then onto heaven. Every
			Friday, the building overflows with thousands of Muslim worshippers who make their prayers 
			outside in the courtyards of the Noble Sanctuary.

		<h3>05. Hassan II Mosque</h3> <br/>

		<p>
			The Hassan II Mosque is the largest in Morocco and the seventh largest in the world, occupying 
			the Atlantic shoreline in Casablanca since 1993. Its minarets are the tallest in the world, 
			at an epic 210 meters and are topped by a laser that shines a light toward Mecca. Inside,
			the walls are handcrafted out of smooth marble, and the glass floor allows visitor to gather a
			glimpse of the seabed in the main hall.

		<h3>06. Blue Mosque</h3> <br/>

		<p>
			Making up an essential part of Istanbul's skyline, the Blue Mosque boasts six needle-like 
			minarets and is a must-see for anyone visiting the majestic city. It was built under the 
			reign of the Ottoman ruler Ahmed I between 1609 and 1616 in a series of domes and half-domes.
			Alongside the beautifully arranged cascade of domes spiling down from the grand central dome,
			the ceiling gleams with 20,000 blue Iznik tiles featuring flowers, trees and abstract patterns.

		<h3>07. Ubudiah Mosque</h3> <br/>
		<img src="StyleSheets and Images/Images/7.jpg"> <br/><br/>
		<p>
			The Ubudiah Mosque in the royal town of Kuala Kangsar is considered to be the most beautiful
			place of worship in Malaysia. It is comprised of four minarets and a golden dome, designed by 
			British architect Arthur Benison Huback at the command of Sultan Idris Mushidul Azam Shah. 
			The Sultan vowed to build a mosque of great beauty as thanksgiving for a recovery from an
			illness. Today, it is a symbol of great pride to all Muslims in the state of Perak.

		<h3>08. Wazir Khan Mosque</h3> <br/>
		<img src="StyleSheets and Images/Images/8.jpg"> <br/><br/>
		<p>
			Located in the northern city of Lahore in Pakistan, on one of the busiest roads in the area,
			the Wazir Khan Mosque has been standing since the 17th century and is one of the most important
			landmarks in the city. The mosque is graced, both inside and out, with fresco paintings and tiles, 
			predominantly featuring colors of cobalt, cerulean blue, greens, oranges, yellows and purples.
			The view from the top overlooking the Kashmiri Bazaar is one of the most breathtaking vantage
			points in Lahore.

		<h3>09. Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba</h3> <br/>
		<img src="StyleSheets and Images/Images/9.jpg"> <br/><br/>
		<p>
			Within the heartlands of southern Spain, the Cordoba Mosque is one of the finest examples of Moorish
			architecture here. Although the building was originally a 6th century Catholic church, when the Islamic
			world spread to Spain in the 8th century, it became one of 300 European mosques built to rival
			the splendors of Constantinople and Damascus. Divided into Muslims and Christian halves in 711,
			it was converted back into a Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century.
